## Submission Instructions

Please read details on [Academic Integrity](/#academic-integrity) fully. These are shared by all assignments in CS 241.

We will be using GitHub as our hand-in system this semester. Our grading system will checkout your most recent (pre-deadline) commit for grading. Therefore, to hand in your code, all you have to do is commit and push to your Github repository.

{% assign filename = page.url | replace_first: '/', '' | replace: '/', '-'  | replace: '.html', '.md' %}
{% assign submit_dir = page.git_dir | default: filename %}
To check out the provided code for <code class="highlighter-rouge">{{ filename }}</code> from the class repository, go to your cs241 directory (the one you checked out for "know your tools") and run:

```
git pull release master
```

If you run `ls` you will now see a `{{ submit_dir }}` folder, where you can find this assignment! To commit your changes (send them to us), type:

```
git add {{ filename }}
git commit -m "{{ filename }} submission"
git push origin master
```

Your repository directory can be viewed from a web browser from the following URL: 
[https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/{{ site.data.constants.department_code }}{{site.data.constants.course_number}}-{{ site.semester }}/NETID/tree/master/{{ submit_dir }}](https://github-dev.cs.illinois.edu/{{ site.data.constants.department_code }}{{site.data.constants.course_number}}-{{ site.semester }}/NETID/tree/master/{{ submit_dir }}) where NETID is your University NetID. It is important to check that the files you expect to be graded are present and up to date in your remote git copy.
