          Course Description
        </h2>
        This course is designed to challenge you as a programmer and new
        computer scientist at the University of Illinois. Rather than the
        sand-boxed, contained, and simple problems of your previous courses that
        used significant scaffolding and pre-built libraries, you will be
        interacting with a much more complex environment: the entire system and
        even computing networks. Further, you will need to fully understand how
        memory is allocated, used, and re-used within a process. You will also
        need to know how input and output can be optionally buffered between
        processes and files. In short, it is time to remove the training wheels
        of and instead fling open the doors, welcoming you to the big, wide
        world of computing. Oh, and did we mention the challenge of concurrency
        and solving asynchronous problems, so that your program can take
        advantage of the multi-core CPU inside each machine?
