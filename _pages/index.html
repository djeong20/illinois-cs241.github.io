          Course Description
        </h2>
        <p>
            This course is designed to challenge you as a programmer and new
            computer scientist at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. 
            Rather than the sand-boxed, contained, and simple problems of your previous courses that
            used significant scaffolding and pre-built libraries, you will be
            interacting with a much more complex environment: the entire system and
            even computing networks. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You will need to fully understand how memory is allocated, used, and re-used within a process. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You will also need to know how input and output can be optionally buffered between
            processes and files. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In short, it is time to remove the training wheels
            off and instead fling open the doors, welcoming you to the big, wide
            world of computing. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Oh, and did we mention the challenge of concurrency
            and solving asynchronous problems, so that your program can take
            advantage of the multi-core CPU inside each machine?

                    <p>
                       We will follow the UIUC COVID-19 recommendations. For the on-campus instruction please see the following <a href="https://covid19.illinois.edu/on-campus/on-campus-instructors/">instructions</a>. 
                      This course is designed to help you succeed whether you attend in person or learn virtually. If you prefer or are unable to attend in person you may attend online and use online resources. Zoom links for the sections will be posted in Ed.
                    </p>
                    <p> This course is optimized for on-campus in-person students. Though it will be possible to earn an A in CS241 without physically attending not all points and all experiences may be available online.</p>
                    <p> The first two weeks (1/18 - Friday 1/26) of class will be online only. For the remainder, weekly in-person activities (labs, office hours, lectures etc.) will only be available in-person for the week 
                      if the 7 day UIUC positivity testing [average](https://go.illinois.edu/COVIDTestingData) at Sunday afternoon is 1% or lower. This threshold and policy is subject to change.
                     
                      Where possible, alternative online activities will be offered for all weeks via Zoom and other online formats (links will be posted in the class forum). 
                      Equivalent lecture content is available on [ClassTranscribe](https://classtranscribe.illinois.edu) and as the course book. 
                      To protect yourself and others who may be less fortunate than you, for in-person activities participants a fitted, high quality 3-ply mask or (K)N95 mask is [best](https://www.axios.com/n95-mask-protection-covid-958039c9-07f1-45a1-81e7-b7436707fee5.html). </p>
