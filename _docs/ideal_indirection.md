## Overview

In this assignment, you will be working on managing a mapping of 32-bit virtual address space  to a 32-bit physical address space with 4 KB (kilobyte) pages.
Each component of virtual memory has been split up into several files to help you build a mental model of virtual memory.
Reading through these files can start to help you understand the roles of the different hardware and software involved in managing virtual memory.
You will only have to write two functions in `mmu.c`, but it requires a good understanding of the coursebook and decent knowledge of the rest of the provided code.

The rest of this documentation will serve to help you understand the purpose of each file and give you a high level understanding of virtual memory.
The implementation details of each function are documented in the header and source files.
It is your responsibility to read every line of code before starting this assignment, since you will not be able to do anything meaningful otherwise.

# Page Tables (`page_table.c` and `page_table.h`)

Each process has two levels of paging:

The top level page table is known as a "page directory" and has entries (page directory entries) that hold the base address of page tables (beginning of a page table).
Each of these page tables hold entries (page table entries) that hold the base address of an actual frame in physical memory, which you will be reading from and writing to.
There are other metadata bits in both the page directory and page table entries that is explained in detail in `page_table.h`.
The actual layout is taken directly from a real 32 bit processor and operating system, which you can read more about in the ["IA-32 Intel® Architecture Software Developer’s Manual"](http://flint.cs.yale.edu/cs422/doc/24547212.pdf#page=88).

For illustrative purposes a Page Table Entry looks like the following:

![Page Table Entry](/images/page_table_entry.png)

Each entry is represented as a struct with bit fields whose syntax you can learn about in a [tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_bit_fields.htm).
The bit fields basically allows us to squeeze multiple flags into a single 32 bit integer.
This means that each entry has not only the physical address to the lower level paging structure, but also metadata bits/flags which are documented in the header file.
However for the purpose of this lab you are only responsible for knowing how the following fields works:

* Page base address, bits 12 through 32
* Present (P) flag, bit 0
* Read/write (R/W) flag, bit 1
* User/supervisor (U/S) flag, bit 2
* Accessed (A) flag, bit 5
* Dirty (D) flag, bit 6

More detailed information about the function of each permission bit is described `page_table.h`. Here are some helpful
guidelines for correctly setting the bits:

* Once a `page_directory_entry` is created, it will remain in physical memory and will not be swapped to disk.
* Each segmentation has a `permissions` field, and there is a permissions struct in `segments.h`. 
If `permissions & WRITE` is not `0`, then it has write permission. Same is true for `READ` and `EXEC`.
* `page_directory_entry`'s should always have read and write permission
* For the purposes of this lab, all `page_table_entry`s and `page_directory_entry`s will have the `user_supervisor` flag
set to `1`
* You only need to keep track of Accessed and Dirty flags for each `page_table_entry`, based on any reading or writing that
has occurred to the `base_addr` stored by the `page_table_entry`.

## Translation Lookaside Buffer (`tlb.c` and `tlb.h`)

The Translation Lookaside Buffer will cache the base virtual address to the corresponding page table entry pointer.
The implementation and header is provided to you.
Make note of the use of double pointers.

The reason why our TLB caches page table entry pointers instead of physical addresses of frames is because you will need to set metadata bits when translating addresses.

# Segments (`segments.c` and `segments.h`)

A process's virtual address space is divided into several segments. You are familiar with many of these:

* Stack
* Heap
* BSS
* Data
* Code

For this lab, a processes' address space is split into memory segments like so:

![Virtual Address Space Layout](http://static.duartes.org/img/blogPosts/linuxFlexibleAddressSpaceLayout.png)

Notice how some of the memory segments like the stack and mmap have an arrow pointing down.
This indicates that these regions "grow down" by decreasing their end boundary's virtual address as you add elements to them.
This is so that the stack and heap can share the same address space, but grow in different directions.
It is now easy to see that if you put too many elements onto the stack it will eventually run into heap memory leading to the classic Stack Overflow.

The reasons why this external structure is needed for this lab is to answer the question: "How do you know when an address is invalid?".
You can not rely on the present bit of a page table entry, since that page may be valid, but just happens to be paged to disk.
The solution is to check to see if an address is in any memory segment with `bool address_in_segmentations(vm_segmentations *segmentations, uint32_t address);`.
If the address is not in any of the process's segments, then you get the dreaded segmentation fault (segfault).

## Kernel (`kernel.c` and `kernel.h`)

For this assignment all the memory allocations will be abstracted by `kernel.c`.

This file will maintain a global array of pages that you will use to model all of physical memory.
That is to say that all virtual addresses get translated to an address in:

`char physical_memory[PHYSICAL_MEMORY_SIZE] __attribute__((aligned(PAGE_SIZE)));`

The caveat to this lab is that it is all done in user space.
That means you are technically mapping one virtual address to another virtual address that represents a physical address.
However, all the concepts involved remain the same in a real operating system's memory management software.

We use a global `char` array for our physical memory as it so happens that global variables such as these are stored
in some of the lowest addresses in memory. Because of this, the array, despite existing in a 64 bit environment, only
needs the 32 lower bits of a 64 bit address to address it. This is great because it allows us to use 32 addresses to
refer to a physical memory location, despite being on a 64 bit system. The downside is that we will need to convert
any 32 bit references to the data into a 64 bit pointer before we actually try to access the physical memory at that
address.

In this lab, we will be dealing with `addr32` type variables to keep track of both virtual and "physical" addresses.
The type `addr32` is just an alias for `uint32_t`, which is just a type that can store a 32 bit value. However,
since our actual VMs are 64 bit, we will need to convert this `addr32` into a system pointer if we ever want to interact
with real physical memory directly (ie, by dereferencing a pointer). We have provided a few helper functions to 
help with this translation: 


```
void *get_system_pointer_from_pte(page_table_entry *entry);
void *get_system_pointer_from_pde(page_directory_entry *entry);
void *get_system_pointer_from_address(addr32 address);
```

The function `get_system_pointer_from_address` will take an `addr32` address and return a system pointer that you can
use to interact with the data at that address. Similarly, the functions `get_system_pointer_from_pte` and
`get_system_pointer_from_pde` can be used to get a pointer for accessing the memory at the `base_addr` of the
`page_table_entry` or `page_directory_entry` (respectively). A good example of using these functions can be found in 
`mmu.c`'s `mmu_add_process` function.

A word of caution: shifting signed numbers can produce unexpected behavior, as it will always extend the
sign, meaning if the most significant bit is `1`, the "leftmost" bits after shifting right will all be `1`s instead of `0`s. 
Do yourself a favor, work with unsigned values.


## Memory Management Unit (`mmu.c`)

For this assignment you are mainly responsible for handling reads to and writes from virtual addresses.

The functions you are to complete are:

```
void mmu_read_from_virtual_address(mmu *this, uintptr_t virtual_address, size_t pid, void *buffer, size_t num_bytes);
void mmu_write_to_virtual_address(mmu *this, uintptr_t virtual_address, size_t pid, const void *buffer, size_t num_bytes);
```
This means you have to translate from a virtual to a physical address:

Also for any virtual address, you should check whether the result has been already cached in the TLB (see `tlb.h`). Otherwise you must search the page tables.

For this lab we have 2 levels of indirection (see `page_table.h`).

The following illustration demonstrates how to translate from a virtual address to a physical address:

![Virtual Address Translation](/images/virtual_address_translation.png)

That this image is saying is that you are to take the top 10 bits of the provided virtual address to index an entry in the page directory of the process.
That entry should contain the base address of a page table.
You are to then take the next 10 bits to index an entry the page table you got in the previous step, which should point to a frame in physical memory.
Finally you are to use the last 12 bits to offset to a particular byte in the 4kb frame.

## Testing

Make sure you throughly test your code as usual. We have provided some tests cases, but we encourage you to write your own as well. Use the provided test cases as a reference to learn to create tests with good coverage.
